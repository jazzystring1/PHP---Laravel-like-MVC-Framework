NOTE

PHP :

MYSQL
1. When dealing with dates, use "Y-%c-%d" date format for date comparison because the other date formats are having problems fetching record having more than 30 days.

Array :
	- Can be created using array('key' => value)
	- Can be created also using [key => value]

List :
	*Same as Array*

Tuples :
	Considered as object accessin it via $obj->property

------------------------------

ERLANG :

Tuples 
	- {names, "John"}
	- starts with {}
	- Immutable
Lists
	- []
	- Immutable
In order to modify, you must create a copy of a specific tuple or list via pattern matching

-----------------------------

PYTHON:

Tuples
	- (Daniel, David)
	- starts with ()
	- Immutable means data can't be change nor alter
	- The index must be integer in accessing data
	- Can create tuple without "()"/Parenthesis seperated by comma like name = 'David', 'Daniel'

Lists
	- []
	- The index must be integer in accessing data
	- Putting key is invalid means ['number' : 123] is invalid

Set
	- {Daniel, David} (same as tuple in ERLANG)
	- Does not support key indexing

Dictionary
	- {"name" : "Daniel"}
	- Mutable
	- The index is based on the key of the given value
